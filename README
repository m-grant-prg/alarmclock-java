1 ... Project Description
=========================

This is a GUI AlarmClock application implementing two independent alarms. Each
alarm can be set to 'Alarm At', eg 13:15, or 'Alarm In', eg 1 hour 10 mins.
Each alarm also incorporates a 'Snooze' button that will pause a ringing alarm
for 5 minutes.

---------------------

2 ... This Repository
=====================

AlarmClock is written as a NetBeans Java project and as such the files tracked
by Git are determined by NetBeans.

------------------

3 ... Installation
==================

As a Java application it can run on many operating systems so this repository
does not include any specific installation support.
Other projects / repositories listed below provide installation packages
although the list begins with just using the compiled jar from this source code.

A) Compile the source code to AlarmClock.jar. This file can then be run using
the command:
java -jar "/YourPath/AlarmClock.jar"

B) An associated GitHub repository AlarmClockATDist is available. This
repository provides an installation mechanism for any system supporting the
AutoTools tool-chain, eg Linux.

C) Another associated GitHub repository AlarmClockWindowsDist is available. This
repository provides the mechanism to produce a Windows msi installer package.

D) A PPA (Personal Package Archive) is also available on LaunchPad which
provides a neat mechanism for installing AlarmClock and keeping it up-to-date on
Ubuntu. The PPA resides on LaunchPad here:
